## Welcome to Tatsujin Labs 👋

**Tatsujin Labs** is a dedicated team focused on advancing the Based Rollup ecosystem.

We are currently building a [**high-performance Rust-based Taiko node**](https://github.com/TatsujinLabs/taiko-reth) tailored for Based Rollups.

Following this, our efforts will shift toward developing **Layer 2 PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) / MEV infrastructure and tooling**, aiming to empower developers and enhance the scalability and efficiency of Based Rollup networks.
